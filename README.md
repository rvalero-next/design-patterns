# design-patterns

This is a simple project to training the use of Design Patterns.

This project contains 3 java applications grouped in the two Katas:

## Kata 1: Kitti-Simulator

It is a simple application to train the use of the Strategy Pattern.
For this application, we have a simple simulator of a cat that can display, jump and meow.

The only that we need to do complete the simulation (Simulation class) following the indications in the comments.

## Kata 2: Cat API & Cat Kpis

It is a simple application to train the use of the DoubleTest Pattern and the design patterns in general.

For this Kata run mvn install (./mvnw install or mvn install) of both projects and go to the CatKpis README.md to see the TODO list.
