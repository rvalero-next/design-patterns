## Hints

- First, try to run the spring boot application and go to localhost:8080 to see the KPIs
- To run this application you can use the command `./mvnw spring-boot:run` but is better to run the CatKpisApplication.java file with your favorite IDE (IntellijIDEa, visualcode, etc).
- Then, try to fix the KPIs in the KpiService.java file.
- After that, try to do the refactor of the KpiService.java and the implementation of the CatKpiTest.java at the same time.
